Inverted-Pendulum-Modeling-
===========================

This report introduces an inverted pendulum example and a typical procedure used to design and realize of a fuzzy controller. To simulate a fuzzy control system it is necessary to specify a mathematical model of the inverted pendulum. Using MATLAB a code representing the mathematical model for the pendulum is integrated, membership functions are realized. The mathematical model is represented by a differential equation of second order which require using the ode23 command in Matlab in order to solve.
